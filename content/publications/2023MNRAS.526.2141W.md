abstract: "The radial metallicity distribution of the Milky Way's disc is an\n   \
  \     important observational constraint for models of the formation\n        and\
  \ evolution of our Galaxy. It informs our understanding of the\n        chemical\
  \ enrichment of the Galactic disc and the dynamical\n        processes therein,\
  \ particularly radial migration. We investigate\n        how the metallicity changes\
  \ with guiding radius in the thin disc\n        using a sample of red giant stars\
  \ with robust astrometric,\n        spectroscopic, and asteroseismic parameters.\
  \ Our sample contains\n        668 stars with guiding radii 4 < R_g < 11 kpc and\n\
  \        asteroseismic ages covering the whole history of the thin disc\n      \
  \  with precision \u2248 25   per cent. We use MCMC\n        analysis to measure\
  \ the gradient and its intrinsic spread in\n        bins of age and construct a\
  \ hierarchical Bayesian model to\n        investigate the evolution of these parameters\
  \ independently of\n        the bins. We find a smooth evolution of the gradient\
  \ from\n        \u2248-0.07 dex kpc^-1 in the youngest stars\n        to \u2248\
  -0.04 dex kpc^-1 in stars older\n        than 10 Gyr, with no break at intermediate\
  \ ages. Our results are\n        consistent with those based on asteroseismic ages\
  \ from CoRoT,\n        with that found in Cepheid variables for stars younger than\
  \ 1\n        Gyr, and with open clusters for stars younger than 6 Gyr. For\n   \
  \     older stars we find a significantly lower metallicity in our\n        sample\
  \ than in the clusters, suggesting a survival bias\n        favouring more metal-rich\
  \ clusters. We also find that the\n        chemical evolution model of Chiappini\
  \ '09 is too metal poor in\n        the early stages of disc formation. Our results\
  \ provide strong\n        new constraints for the growth and enrichment of the thin\
  \ disc\n        and radial migration, which will facilitate new tests of model\n\
  \        conditions and physics."
