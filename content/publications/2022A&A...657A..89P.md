abstract: "Context. Increasing the number of detected exoplanets is far from\n   \
  \     anecdotal, especially for long-period planets that require a\n        long\
  \ duration of observation. More detections imply a better\n        understanding\
  \ of the statistical properties of exoplanet\n        populations, and detailed\
  \ modelling of their host stars also\n        enables thorough discussions of star-planet\
  \ interactions and\n        orbital evolution of planetary systems. \\Aims: In\n\
  \        the context of the discovery of a new planetary system, we aim\n      \
  \  to perform a complete study of HD 29399 and its companion by\n        means of\
  \ radial-velocity measurements, seismic characterisation\n        of the host-star,\
  \ and modelling of the orbital evolution of the\n        system. \\Methods: High-resolution\
  \ spectra of HD\n        29399 were acquired with the CORALIE spectrograph mounted\
  \ on the\n        1.2-m Swiss telescope located at La Silla Observatory (Chile)\
  \ as\n        part of the CASCADES survey. We used the moments of the cross-\n \
  \       correlation function profile as well as the photometric\n        variability\
  \ of the star as diagnostics to distinguish between\n        stellar and planetary-induced\
  \ signals. To model the host star we\n        combined forward modelling with global\
  \ and local minimisation\n        approaches and inversion techniques. We also studied\
  \ the orbital\n        history of the system under the effects of both dynamical\
  \ and\n        equilibrium tides. \\Results: We present the\n        detection of\
  \ a long-period giant planet. Combining these\n        measurements with photometric\
  \ observations by TESS, we are able\n        to thoroughly model the host star and\
  \ study the orbital\n        evolution of the system. We derive stellar and planetary\
  \ masses\n        of 1.17 \xB1 0.10 M_\u2299 and\n        1.59 \xB1 0.08 M_Jup,\
  \ respectively, and an age\n        for the system of 6.2 Gyr. We show that neither\
  \ dynamical nor\n        equilibrium tides have been able to affect the orbital\
  \ evolution\n        of the planet. Moreover, no engulfment is predicted for the\n\
  \        future evolution of the system.\n        \\on observations collected with\n\
  \        the CORALIE echelle spectrograph on the 1.2-m Euler Swiss\n        telescope\
  \ at La Silla Observatory, ESO, Chile."
