abstract: "Context. The advent of asteroseismology as the golden path to precisely\n\
  \        characterize single stars naturally led to synergies with the\n       \
  \ field of exoplanetology. Today, the precise determination of\n        stellar\
  \ masses, radii and ages for exoplanet-host stars is a\n        driving force in\
  \ the development of dedicated software and\n        techniques to achieve this\
  \ goal. However, as various approaches\n        exist, it is clear that they all\
  \ have advantages and\n        inconveniences and that there is a trade-off between\
  \ accuracy,\n        efficiency, and robustness of the techniques. \\Aims: We aim\
  \ to compare and discuss various modelling techniques\n        for exoplanet-host\
  \ red giant stars for which TESS data are\n        available. The results of the\
  \ seismic modelling are then used to\n        study the dynamical evolution and\
  \ atmospheric evaporation of the\n        planetary systems. \\Methods: We study,\
  \ in detail,\n        the robustness, accuracy and precision of various seismic\n\
  \        modelling techniques when applied to four exoplanet-host red\n        giants\
  \ observed by TESS. We discuss the use of global seismic\n        indexes, the use\
  \ of individual radial frequencies and that of\n        non-radial oscillations.\
  \ In each case, we discuss the advantages\n        and inconveniences of the modelling\
  \ technique. \\Results: We determine precise and accurate masses of exoplanet-\n\
  \        host red giant stars orbited by long-period Jupiter-like planets\n    \
  \    using various modelling techniques. For each target, we also\n        provide\
  \ a model-independent estimate of the mass from a mean\n        density inversion\
  \ combined with radii values from Gaia and\n        spectroscopic data. We show\
  \ that no engulfment or migration is\n        observed for these targets, even if\
  \ their evolution is extended\n        beyond their estimated seismic ages up the\
  \ red giant branch.\n        \\on observations collected with\n        the CORALIE\
  \ echelle spectrograph on the 1.2 m Euler Swiss\n        telescope at La Silla Observatory,\
