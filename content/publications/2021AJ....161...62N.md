description: "Asteroseismology is an exceptional tool for studying stars using the\n\
  \        properties of observed modes of oscillation. So far the process\n     \
  \   of performing an asteroseismic analysis of a star has remained\n        somewhat\
  \ esoteric and inaccessible to nonexperts. In this\n        software paper we describe\
  \ PBjam, an open-source Python package\n        for analyzing the frequency spectra\
  \ of solar-like oscillators in\n        a simple but principled and automated way.\
  \ The aim of PBjam is\n        to provide a set of easy-to-use tools to extract\
  \ information\n        about the radial and quadropole oscillations in stars that\n\
  \        oscillate like the Sun, which may then be used to infer bulk\n        properties\
  \ such as stellar mass, radius, age, or even structure.\n        Asteroseismology\
  \ and its data analysis methods are becoming\n        increasingly important as\
  \ space-based photometric observatories\n        are producing a wealth of new data,\
  \ allowing asteroseismology to\n        be applied in a wide range of contexts such\
  \ as exoplanet,\n        stellar structure and evolution, and Galactic population\n\
  \        studies. * Release 1.0.0 Zenodo, doi:10.5281/zenodo.4300079."
