description: "High-precision asteroseismology has improved estimates of stellar\n\
  \        masses, radii, and ages. However, this has revealed inaccuracies\n    \
  \    in typical assumptions regarding properties such as helium\n        abundance\
  \ (Y) and the mixing-length theory parameter\n        (\u03B1). We applied a hierarchical\
  \ Bayesian\n        model to a sample of main sequence, low-mass dwarf stars to\n\
  \        encode population level information about Y and\n        \u03B1. We showed\
  \ that our method reduced the\n        uncertainties in mass, radius and age to\
  \ 2.5%, 1.2% and 12%\n        respectively compared to grid-based modelling methods.\
  \ We also\n        show that through our new method, uncertainties decrease with\n\
  \        larger sample sizes. With many more asteroseismic targets\n        expected\
  \ from PLATO, we expect to further improve our inference\n        of bulk stellar\
  \ parameters."
