description: "With recent advances in modelling stars using high-precision\n     \
  \   asteroseismology, the systematic effects associated with our\n        assumptions\
  \ of stellar helium abundance (Y) and the mixing-\n        length theory parameter\
  \ (\u03B1_MLT) are\n        becoming more important. We apply a new method to improve\
  \ the\n        inference of stellar parameters for a sample of Kepler dwarfs\n \
  \       and subgiants across a narrow mass range (0.8  M  1.2 \n        M_\u2299\
  ). In this method, we include a statistical treatment of\n        Y and the \u03B1\
  _MLT. We develop a\n        hierarchical Bayesian model to encode information about\
  \ the\n        distribution of Y and \u03B1_MLT in the\n        population, fitting\
  \ a linear helium enrichment law including an\n        intrinsic spread around this\
  \ relation and normal distribution in\n        \u03B1_MLT. We test various levels\
  \ of pooling\n        parameters, with and without solar data as a calibrator. When\n\
  \        including the Sun as a star, we find the gradient for the\n        enrichment\
  \ law, \u0394 Y / \u0394 Z =\n        1.05+0.28\xAD0.25 and the mean\n        \u03B1\
  _MLT in the population, \u03BC _\u03B1 =\n        1.90+0.10\xAD0.09. While accounting\
  \ for the\n        uncertainty in Y and \u03B1_MLT, we are still\n        able to\
  \ report statistical uncertainties of 2.5 per cent in\n        mass, 1.2 per cent\
  \ in radius, and 12 per cent in age. Our method\n        can also be applied to\
  \ larger samples that will lead to improved\n        constraints on both the population\
  \ level inference and the star-\n        by-star fundamental parameters."
