description: "Despite a growing sample of precisely measured stellar rotation periods\n\
  \        and ages, the strength of magnetic braking and the degree of\n        departure\
  \ from standard (Skumanich-like) spindown have remained\n        persistent questions,\
  \ particularly for stars more evolved than\n        the Sun. Rotation periods can\
  \ be measured for stars older than\n        the Sun by leveraging asteroseismology,\
  \ enabling models to be\n        tested against a larger sample of old field stars.\
  \ Because\n        asteroseismic measurements of rotation do not depend on starspot\n\
  \        modulation, they avoid potential biases introduced by the need\n      \
  \  for a stellar dynamo to drive starspot production. Using a\n        neural network\
  \ trained on a grid of stellar evolution models and\n        a hierarchical model-fitting\
  \ approach, we constrain the onset of\n        weakened magnetic braking. We find\
  \ that a sample of stars with\n        asteroseismically-measured rotation periods\
  \ and ages is\n        consistent with models that depart from standard spindown\
  \ prior\n        to reaching the evolutionary stage of the Sun. We test our\n  \
  \      approach using neural networks trained on model grids produced\n        by\
  \ separate stellar evolution codes with differing physical\n        assumptions\
  \ and find that the choices of grid physics can\n        influence the inferred\
  \ properties of the braking law. We\n        identify the normalized critical Rossby\
  \ number Ro_\n        crit/ Ro_\u2299 = 0.91\xB10.03 as the threshold for the\n\
  \        departure from standard rotational evolution. This suggests that\n    \
  \    weakened magnetic braking poses challenges to gyrochronology for\n        roughly\
  \ half of the main sequence lifetime of sun-like stars."
