description: "Characterising stellar fundamental parameters is difficult. For\n  \
  \      instance, generating new stellar evolutionary tracks to reflect\n       \
  \ observations is computationally expensive. Additionally,\n        quantifying\
  \ the uncertainty inherent in comparison to stellar\n        model grids can be\
  \ challenging. To mitigate this issue, we use a\n        neural network as an emulator,\
  \ converting discrete grids of\n        stellar models into continuous functions\
  \ with easily\n        quantifiable emulation uncertainties. Once trained, this\n\
  \        emulator is capable of rapidly predicting a host of observable\n      \
  \  quantities including individual mode frequencies, each with\n        easily quantifiable\
  \ emulation uncertainties. Trained emulators\n        are then used for likelihood\
  \ estimation in Bayesian inference to\n        recover plausible estimates of the\
  \ posterior distributions. We\n        present results for inferred fundamental\
  \ parameters of solar-\n        like oscillators. We observe that the recovered\
  \ posteriors for\n        simulated stars may exhibit non-Gaussian distributions,\n\
  \        multimodality, and strong covariance. Furthermore, we present\n       \
  \ results obtained from real stars. Finally, we show how\n        covariance in\
  \ emulation prediction residuals should be accounted\n        for, and discuss the\
  \ improvements from using ensemble approaches\n        to emulation in the future."
