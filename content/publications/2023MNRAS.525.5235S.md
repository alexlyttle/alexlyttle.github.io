description: "Young \u03B4 Scuti (Sct) stars have proven to be valuable\n        asteroseismic\
  \ targets, but obtaining robust uncertainties on\n        their inferred properties\
  \ is challenging. We aim to quantify the\n        random uncertainties in grid-based\
  \ modelling of\n        \u03B4 Sct stars. We apply Bayesian inference\n        using\
  \ nested sampling and a neural network emulator of stellar\n        models, testing\
  \ our method on both simulated and real stars.\n        Based on results from simulated\
  \ stars, we demonstrate that our\n        method can recover plausible posterior\
  \ probability density\n        estimates while accounting for both the random uncertainty\
  \ from\n        the observations and neural network emulation. We find that the\n\
  \        posterior distributions of the fundamental parameters can be\n        significantly\
  \ non-Gaussian and multimodal, and have strong\n        covariance. We conclude\
  \ that our method reliably estimates the\n        random uncertainty in the modelling\
  \ of \u03B4 Sct\n        stars and paves the way for the investigation and quantification\n\
  \        of the systematic uncertainty."
