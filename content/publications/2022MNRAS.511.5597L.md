abstract: "Grid-based modelling is widely used for estimating stellar parameters.\n\
  \        However, stellar model grid is sparse because of the\n        computational\
  \ cost. This paper demonstrates an application of a\n        machine-learning algorithm\
  \ using the Gaussian Process (GP)\n        Regression that turns a sparse model\
  \ grid on to a continuous\n        function. We train GP models to map five fundamental\
  \ inputs\n        (mass, equivalent evolutionary phase, initial metallicity,\n \
  \       initial helium fraction, and the mixing-length parameter) to\n        observable\
  \ outputs (effective temperature, surface gravity,\n        radius, surface metallicity,\
  \ and stellar age). We test the GP\n        predictions for the five outputs using\
  \ off-grid stellar models\n        and find no obvious systematic offsets, indicating\
  \ good accuracy\n        in predictions. As a further validation, we apply these\
  \ GP\n        models to characterize 1000 fake stars. Inferred masses and ages\n\
  \        determined with GP models well recover true values within one\n       \
  \ standard deviation. An important consequence of using GP-based\n        interpolation\
  \ is that stellar ages are more precise than those\n        estimated with the original\
  \ sparse grid because of the full\n        sampling of fundamental inputs."
