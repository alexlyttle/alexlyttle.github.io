description: "The detailed modelling of stellar oscillations is a powerful approach\
  \ to\n        characterizing stars. However, poor treatment of systematics in\n\
  \        theoretical models leads to misinterpretations of stars. Here,\n      \
  \  we propose a more principled statistical treatment for the\n        systematics\
  \ to be applied to fitting individual mode frequencies\n        with a typical stellar\
  \ model grid. We introduce a correlated\n        noise model based on a Gaussian\
  \ process (GP) kernel to describe\n        the systematics given that mode frequency\
  \ systematics are\n        expected to be highly correlated. We show that tuning\
  \ the GP\n        kernel can reproduce general features of frequency variations\n\
  \        for changing model input physics and fundamental parameters.\n        Fits\
  \ with the correlated noise model better recover stellar\n        parameters than\
  \ traditional methods that either ignore the\n        systematics or treat them\
  \ as uncorrelated noise."
