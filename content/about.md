I am an astrophysics researcher using machine-learning techniques and Bayesian statistics to improve the inference of stellar masses and ages. Currently, I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the University of Birmingham after graduating with a PhD in July 2023. I have contributed to several open-source projects including numpyro, PBjam, and statsmodels. When I am not researching, I enjoy hiking, bouldering, cycling, and playing boardgames.
