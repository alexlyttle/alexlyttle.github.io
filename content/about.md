I am a research software engineer with a background in astrophysics, machine-learning, and Bayesian inference. I graduated with a Ph.D. from the Sun, Stars, and Exoplanets group at the University of Birmingham in July 2023, after which I continued as a postdoctoral researcher. My research involved building a hierarchical Bayesian framework for improving inference of the radii, masses, and ages of stars. I have contributed to several open-source projects including `numpyro`, `PBjam`, and `statsmodels`. When I am not researching, I enjoy hiking, bouldering, cycling, and playing boardgames.
